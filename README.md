📊 Educational Platform Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing data from an educaional platform to uncover insignts about user engagement, courses performance, and content effectiveness. It is designed to support data_driven decisions that improve learning outcomes and platform efficiency.

## 🔍Objectives:

- Track and visualize user activity and courses completion ratse
- Identify high_performing and underperforming content
- Analyze patterns in student behavior and engagement
- Generate summary report for stakeholders

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies:

- **Python**: Data processing and analysis
- **pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulattion
- **Matplotlib**: Reporting and data export

## 📈 Sample Insights:

- Pack activity hours and days
- Drop_off points in course progression
- Correlation between quiz scores and coures completion

## 🚀 Getting Stared:

1- Clone the repository
2- Place your raw data files in `data/raw`
3- Run `analysis.py` to process and analyze the data
4- View the output in `reports/summary.xlsx`

...📌Notes:
This project is part of my hands_on journey in learning Python and data analysis .
it reflects my ability to work with real_worled data and extract meaningful insights.
